## 1. The Basics: Connecting

The bread and butter of remote management.

* **Standard Connection:**
```bash
ssh username@remote_host

```


* **Connect on a Specific Port:**
```bash
ssh -p 2222 username@remote_host

```


* **Run a Command and Exit:**
```bash
ssh username@remote_host "ls -la"

```

## 2. Key Generation & Management

Using SSH keys is significantly more secure than passwords. Think of the private key as your physical house key and the public key as the lock.

### Generating Keys

* **Modern (ED25519) - Recommended:** Faster and more secure.
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

```


* **Legacy (RSA 4096-bit):**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

```



### Copying Keys to a Server

* **The Automated Way:**
```bash
ssh-copy-id username@remote_host

```


* **The Manual Way (if `ssh-copy-id` is missing):**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh username@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

```

## 3. The SSH Config File (`~/.ssh/config`)

Tired of remembering IP addresses and ports? Create a config file to use "nicknames" for your servers.

**Example Entry:**

```text
Host dev-server
    HostName 192.168.1.50
    User my-username
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

```

**Now you can just type:**

```bash
ssh dev-server

```

## 4. Permissions (The "Don't Lock Yourself Out" Section)

SSH is very picky about permissions. If your files are too "world-readable," SSH will refuse to use them for security reasons.

| File/Folder | Recommended Permission | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.ssh` directory | `700` (drwx------) | `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` |
| Private Key | `600` (-rw-------) | `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` |
| Public Key | `644` (-rw-r--r--) | `chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` |
| `authorized_keys` | `600` (-rw-------) | `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` |

---

## 5. SSH Agent (Managing Passphrases)

If you put a passphrase on your key (and you should!), the `ssh-agent` saves you from typing it every single time you connect.

* **Start the agent:**
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

```


* **Add your key to the agent:**
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

```



---

## 6. Pro Tips & Troubleshooting

* **Check Connection Verbosity:** If a connection is failing, use `-v` (or `-vvv` for deep dive) to see exactly where it hangs.
```bash
ssh -v username@remote_host

```


* **Fix "Host Key Verification Failed":** If a server's identity has changed (e.g., you reinstalled the OS), clear the old entry:
```bash
ssh-keygen -R remote_host_ip

```



> **Note:** Never, ever share your **private key** (the one without the `.pub` extension). It’s the equivalent of handing someone the keys to your digital kingdom.
